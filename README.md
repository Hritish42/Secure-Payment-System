Iâ€™ve Created this program by using RSA,SHA-1 and also tried securing the program by Input Validation. Crashing the program is next to impossible and also this program can be implemented in Real World Scenarios. Doing this assignment was fun. 

I've attached pdf file for code and details regarding the project.

Thank you
